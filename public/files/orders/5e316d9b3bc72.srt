on us.

377
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:46,759
We are overwhelmed
and keep silent.

378
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,396
Suddenly at a sharp turn
in the road,

379
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:51,804
a huge chasm opens up
on our right,

380
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:53,399
and quite close to us,

381
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:56,843
we see the ice-covered peak
of Mount Kazbek

382
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:00,474
with its glaciers
sparkling white in the sun.

383
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:04,077
It is cheek byjowl with us,

384
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:07,988
placid and tall, mute.

385
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:12,085
A mysterious feeling
courses through us.

386
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:17,862
The cliff stands there as if
conjured up by the other cliffs.

387
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:20,869
We feel as though
a being from another world

388
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:25,362
is looking at us.

389
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:28,343
I scramble out of the carriage,

390
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,436
get behind
the folding top and..."

391
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:09,443
What does it mean?

392
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,715
This means "son of beach."

393
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:21,319
- "Bitch."

394
00:45:21,351 --> 00:45:23,331
"Beach," it's, uh...

395
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,491
Beach.

396
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:25,499
- Beach!

397
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:26,592
- Yeah, yeah.

398
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:31,504
I take my bitch to the beach.

399
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:35,738
I take my bitch to the beach.

400
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:39,077
- I take my beach to the beach.

401
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:44,109
<i>- I take my bitch to the beach.</i>

402
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:49,618
- I take my bitch to the bitch.

403
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:54,891
<i>- I take my bitch to the beach.</i>

404
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:59,731
<i>I take my bitch to the beach.</i>

405
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:03,398
<i>I take my bitch</i>

406
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,907
<i>to the beach.</i>

407
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,239
<i>I take my bitch</i>

408
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,745
<i>to the beach.</i>

409
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,908
<i>I take my bitch</i>

410
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,416
<i>to the beach!</i>

411
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,441
- I take my bitch to the beach!

412
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:18,714
Okay, okay, okay.

413
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:20,847
Now we must drink.

414
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:29,592
- Hey, thank you.
Thank you.

415
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,655
- Ah.

416
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,564
- Ah!
Ahh.

417
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:34,728
- Yes, mine, mine, mine.

418
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,872
- Mmm.

419
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,244
- Now we drink.

420
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:48,307
- Do you have a bug on you?

421
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,147
- We drink to woman.

422
00:46:50,174 --> 00:46:51,312
Okay?

423
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:52,342
- Okay.

424
00:46:52,376 --> 00:46:54,549
- You must stand up.

425
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:55,648
- Okay.

426
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,488
- On the... no, not... not...

427
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,858
Sit down.
Sit down.

428
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:00,953
On the knee.

429
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,657
- Oh, on the knees?

430
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:06,328
- For... to woman!

431
00:47:06,356 --> 00:47:07,801
- To woman!
- Yes.

432
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,533
Without woman, life is nothing.

433
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:11,596
I cannot.

434
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,698
<i>- Gaumarjos.</i>

435
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:14,765
<i>- Gaumarjos.
- Gaumarjos.</i>

436
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:16,573
<i>- Gaumarjos.</i>

437
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,772
- Oh.

438
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:24,615
Oh, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.

439
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,016
Next lesson.

440
00:47:31,215 --> 00:47:33,422
I...

441
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:36,260
I take a shit

442
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:38,197
on the sheet.

443
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:41,362
- I take sheet

444
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:42,529
on the sheet.

445
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,561
No.

446
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:45,699
Okay.

447
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:47,208
- I take shit...

448
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:49,233
- A shit.
- Shit.

449
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:50,677
- Shit.

450
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,044
- Shit!

451
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,481
- Alex.
- Hmm?

452
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:00,147
- I have to pee.

453
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:02,316
- Yeah.

454
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,376
- Whoo!

455
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:36,680
Ahh.

456
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:42,319
Whoo.

457
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:44,519
- One, two...

458
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,255
Good.

459
00:49:53,523 --> 00:49:55,161
- Almost, almost.

460
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:00,133
Perfect throw.

461
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,870
One, two...

462
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:08,906
<i>- Gamarjoba.
- Gamarjoba.</i>
